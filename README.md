# Biomarkers for Neurodegenerative Disorders

This repository hosts the course materials for the biostatistics module of the [Biomarkers for Neurodegenerative Disorders](https://www.barcelonabeta.org/en/community/events/6th-workshop-biomarkers-neurodegenerative-diseases) course at BarcelonaBeta Brain Research Center, May 15 to 19, 2023.

Statistical and visualization techniques will be demonstrated using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) applied to data from the [Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/). If you would like to execute the R code on your own machine, you should [apply for access](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/access-data/) to ADNI and [download and install the ADNIMERGE R package](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/instruction-ADNIMERGE-packages.pdf).

[RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) is also highly recommended.
